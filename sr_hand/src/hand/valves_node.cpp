* @brief Contains the main for the real arm. We start the publishers / subscribers in this node.
* They all share the same RealArm object, this way the subscriber can update the arm properties,
* while the publishers publish up to date data. The diagnostics and the other publisher are started
* in two different threads, to allow them to be published at different frequencies.
