 *
 * @brief Contains the main for the EtherCAT wrapper. We start the publishers / subscribers in this node.
 * They all share the same CANCompatibilityArm object, this way the subscriber can update the hand properties,
 * while the publishers publish up to date data. The diagnostics and the other publisher are started
 * in two different threads, to allow them to be published at different frequencies.
